Title: Exit relay pinning for web services

0. Overview

  To mitigate the harm caused by malicious exit relays, this proposal
  presents a novel scheme -- exit relay pinning -- to allow web sites to
  express that Tor connections should preferably originate from a set of
  predefined exit relays.  This proposal is currently in draft state.
  Any feedback is appreciated.

1. Motivation

  Malicious exit relays are increasingly becoming a problem.  We have
  been witnessing numerous opportunistic attacks, but also highly
  sophisticated, targeted attacks that are financially motivated.  So
  far, we have been looking for malicious exit relays using active
  probing and a number of heuristics, but since it is inexpensive to
  keep setting up new exit relays, we are facing an uphill battle.

  Similar to the now-superseded concept of exit enclaves, this proposal
  enables web services to express that Tor clients should prefer a
  predefined set of exit relays when connecting to the service.  We
  encourage sensitive sites to set up their own exit relays and have Tor
  clients prefer these relays, thus greatly mitigating the risk of
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
